# MSDS 400: Math for Data Scientists 

## Course Description
Mathematics is the underlying basis of many aspects of data science. This course will provide students with an overview of much of the mathematics used throughout the MSDS program. The course will begin with a brief overview of algebraic concepts and linear functions, including least squares lines. Some aspects of linear algebra will also be covered, such as operations with matrices, linear systems of equations, and linear programming. The course will also touch on discrete probability covering concepts such as conditional probability, Bayes’ Theorem, and the binomial distributions. Following this, the course will move on to topics in calculus including derivatives, integrals, and continuous probability distributions. The course will then close with a few topics in discrete mathematics – graph theory and algorithms.
